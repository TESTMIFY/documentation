# Project Description

The objective of the project is to design a flexible numerical model of the thermal energy storage in Python.

Use of open source programming language for fast and flexible modelling of energy systems has gained tremendous attention. Thermal energy storage is an essential energy system with a wide range of technological applications. Operation of the energy storage highly depends on the type of the system and its performance parameters. The dynamics of the storage system can be represented by a set of nonlinear governing equations, which can be solved using appropriate numerical method and boundary conditions. In this project, a numerical model of the hot water storage tank will be developed using Python. The  model framework should be flexible to simulate different input conditions, for example, inlet flow, inlet temperature, etc.
